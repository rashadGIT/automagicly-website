## FAQ Content (Copy Everything Below)

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What is AutoMagicly? | AutoMagicly designs and implements AI-powered workflows that handle repetitive tasks across email, CRM, documents, scheduling, and reporting. We automate the busywork so you can run your business faster. |
| What services does AutoMagicly offer? | We offer two main services: (1) AI Partnership - ongoing support with continuous improvements, monitoring, and monthly roadmaps for long-term optimization, and (2) Simple Workflow Automation - one-off builds with training and handoff for teams starting small or solving a specific problem. |
| How much does automation cost? | We have three pricing tiers: Simple Workflows start at $500 for single integrations with minimal logic, Medium Workflows are $1,500 for most common needs with multiple integrations, and Complex Workflows are $3,000 for advanced custom logic across multiple systems. |
| What tools do you integrate with? | We integrate with popular business tools including Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, QuickBooks, HubSpot, Salesforce, Notion, Slack, Airtable, Zapier, Make, and many more. If you use a specific tool, we can likely connect it or find a workaround. |
| Will this replace my employees? | No. Automation handles repetitive tasks so your team can focus on higher-value work like customer relationships, strategy, and creativity. Think of it as giving your team superpowers, not replacing them. |
| How do you handle security and data privacy? | We follow security best practices including encrypted connections, minimal data access (only what is needed), and compliance with industry standards. We never store sensitive customer data unless required for the workflow, and we document all data flows for your review. |
| How long does a workflow take to build? | Simple workflows can often be built in days to a week. More complex automations involving multiple tools and custom logic may take a few weeks. We will give you a realistic timeline during your AI Audit. |
| Do I need to change my current tools? | Usually no. We build automations around your existing tools and workflows. In rare cases, we might suggest a better tool if it significantly improves the automation, but the choice is always yours. |
| What is the difference between AI Partnership and One-Off? | AI Partnership is ongoing support with continuous improvements, monitoring, and monthly roadmaps - best for teams that want long-term optimization. One-Off builds a single workflow with training and handoff - best for teams starting small or solving a specific problem. |
| What if I do not like the automation? | We work iteratively and get your approval at each stage. If something is not working, we will refine it until it does. Our goal is to save you time and reduce frustration, not add to it. |
| Can you automate Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace? | Yes! Both are commonly used platforms, and we have extensive experience building automations for Outlook, Teams, OneDrive, Gmail, Google Drive, Calendar, Sheets, and more. |
| What happens after the AI Audit? | After the audit, we will send you a summary of opportunities with estimated time savings and complexity. If you want to move forward, we will prioritize the highest-impact workflows and create a project plan. No pressure - the audit is free and there is no obligation. |
| Do you offer refunds or guarantees? | We work collaboratively and iteratively to ensure you are happy with the result. If there is an issue, we will fix it. Specific refund terms depend on the engagement type and will be outlined in your agreement. |
| What is the AI Audit? | The AI Audit is a free 30-minute consultation where we review your current processes, identify automation opportunities, and estimate time savings. There is no obligation to move forward after the audit. |
| How does the process work? | Our process has 4 steps: (1) Audit your current process to understand your needs, (2) Pick the best opportunities with highest ROI, (3) Build and test workflows with your approval at each stage, (4) Deploy, train your team, and iterate based on feedback. |
| Can you give examples of automations you build? | Yes! We build Lead Follow-Up Assistants (instant personalized replies to new leads), Invoice & Receipt Processing (automatic data extraction and syncing), Appointment Scheduling with Reminders (reduce no-shows by 40-60%), Proposal Intake Triage (auto-summarize and route RFPs), Customer Support FAQ Assistants (answer common questions instantly), Weekly Reporting Automation (pull data from multiple sources), Recruiting & Onboarding workflows (automated document collection and tracking), and Social/Content Helpers (AI drafts content and schedules posting). |
| What kind of time savings can I expect? | Typical savings range from 5-10 hours per week for invoice processing, 3-5 hours per week for reporting automation, and significant time savings on lead follow-up and appointment scheduling. The ROI Calculator on our website can help estimate your specific savings. |
| How fast can I see ROI on automation? | For a typical medium complexity workflow ($1,500 build cost), most businesses see payback in 10 months and net savings of over $1,700 in the first year. Simple workflows ($500) pay back even faster, often in 3-4 months. |
| What features come with AI Partnership? | AI Partnership includes ongoing support and continuous improvements, monitoring and iteration to optimize performance, a monthly automation roadmap with prioritized improvements, and unlimited workflow adjustments as your business changes. |
| What features come with Simple Workflow Automation? | Simple Workflow Automation includes building a single workflow end-to-end focused on solving one specific problem, training and handoff documentation so your team can take ownership, optional maintenance packages if you need support later, and faster turnaround often delivered in days to a few weeks. |
| How do I get started? | Book a free AI Audit on our website. During the 30-minute call, we will review your processes, identify opportunities, and give you a clear picture of what is possible. There is no obligation to move forward. |
